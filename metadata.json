"description": "An icon taskbar for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash into the gnome main panel so that the application launchers and system tray are combined into a single panel, similar to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+. A separate dock is no longer needed for easy access to running and favorited applications.\n\nIt is recommended to set Top Bar > Show Applications Menu off in Gnome Tweak Tool so that the application menu for native gnome apps will be presented within the application's window. It is also recommended to turn Windows > Titlebar Buttons > Minimize & Maximize on.",
